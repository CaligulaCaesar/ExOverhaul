#### Creating special t5 capital buildings for Habitats.
# 
# I assume you can generate this quicker with your script than I can do so manually- Please add a special capital upgrade/direct build to habitat unique buildings. For example, Solar processor should upgrade to a capital version of solar processor, which has the special adjacency bonus of t5 buildings and higher production. 
# The only different building should be the habitat unity buildings (i added a hivemind/machine empire variation as well), which should upgrade to autocurating vault/alpha hub if there is a capital available.  

## As for RW/Machine world specific t5 buildings - I think these should be simply t5 buildings, but we should buff the t5 buildings by giving these +2 adjacency rather than the current +1.
