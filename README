Well. A collection of mods. Not sure what we need a README for :P

Few words about git instead :P I would suggest you actually make a checkout of the repository into your ../Documents/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod folder. 

To do that you will first need to rename to old one as git always wants to checkout into an emtry folder. If you set an ssh key up in your github account (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) and install some git client (I'm using https://git-for-windows.github.io/ on windows) you can then checkout via "git clone git@github.com:Goldziher/ExOverhaul.git mod" (assuming you are in the Stellaris folder an renamed the original mod folder). You can then move workshop mod files into that folder. They won't interfere with the git repository. 

That way you can now work on stuff, check whether in runs in-game and use all git features easily.
