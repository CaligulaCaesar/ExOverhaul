[h1]ASCENSION PERKS[/h1]

[u]Galactic Force Projection[/u]: Removed the +1 ascension perk prerequisite. 
[u]World Shaper[/u]: Terraforming Speed bonus increased to 75% (was 50%), terraforming cost reduction bonus increased to -33% (was -25%). Now gives both Gaia Terraformation and Climate Restoration as tech research options.
[u]Master Builders[/u]: Does not simply give mega-engineering but rather gives this tech as a research option. Added -25% megastructure price reduction bonus. 
[u]Technological Ascendancy[/u]: Research bonus increased to 15% (was 10%).
[u]Shared Destiny[/u]: Added -50% subject cooldown reduction bonus. 
[u]One Vision[/u]: removed the bonus of this AP and changed it to +1 civic points. Now available to all ethics/authorities (previously restricted to non-gestalt consciousness only).
[u]Synthethic Age[/u]: this AP is now also available for Ascended Synthethic Empires - giving +2 Robot mod points to them and the -33% species modification reduction. Also reduced the prerequisite from 2 to 1 ascension perk. 
[u]Machine/Cybertronic Worlds[/u]: this AP was changed to synergize with the ExOverhaul: Cybertronic Worlds mod. When this mod is present, the Ascension perk is called Cybertronic Worlds and it is available for both Machine and Synthethically ascended empires, unlocking the special artificial planets called Cybertronic Worlds. If this mod is not active, this AP is called Machine Worlds and it functions as it does in vanilla.
